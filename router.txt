User EXEC level: allows a person to access only a limited number of basic monitoring commands. In 
this mode, the router or switch prompt is displayed as:  

hostname> 

The right arrow (>) in the prompt indicates that the router or switch is at the user EXEC mode.
 
Privileged EXEC level: allows a person to access all router commands (including configuration and 
management) and can be password protected to allow only authorized people to access the router. In this 
mode the symbol “#” is displayed as the prompt. 

hostname#

Router commands 

Router > show show running system information 
Router > where list active connections 
Router > sh? List all commands that begins with “sh”
 
Press the up arrow to see or reuse the last entered command. Press it again to go to the command before 
that. Press the down arrow to go back through the list. 

Enter the Privileged EXEC level. 

Router > enable [Enter] 

Use the Help command ? to see the list of available commands in the privileged level. 

Router # ? 

Practice the frequently used privileged commands below: 

Router# show ip interface Learn about the status of the interfaces of this router
 
Router# show run View the configuration of the router 

Router# show running-config View the Running Configuration. (There are two different 
configurations stored on the router; the Running Configuration and the Start‐Up Configuration. The 
Running Configuration is your current, working configuration. It is stored in the RAM memory of 
the router.) 

Router# show startupconfig View the Start‐Up configuration. It is the configuration that is loaded 
when the router initializes 

Router# show version Find the version and system information about your router 

Router# show memory Find memory information about the router 

Router# configure terminal 

Router(config)# hostname r1 Change the router name from “Router” to “r1”. The command prompt 
will look now r1(config)# 

Router(config)# <CTRL>+Z Switch from configuration to privileged mode 

In the Privileged EXEC level use the show command to see detailed information about the network 
interfaces of the router. 
Router # show interfaces [Enter] 

Now enter the Configuration level to assign an IP address to the router. 

Router# configure terminal [Enter] 

Use an IP address (eg. 10.128.20.254) and subnet mask 255.255.0.0 for the values. Then do the 
following: 

Router(config) # interface fa 0/0 [Enter] 

This will ensure that you are configuring the 0/0 interface since there could be multiple interfaces 
with names 0/0, 0/1 …etc. 

Router(config‐if ) # ip address (given ip address) (given subnet mask) [Enter] 

Router(config‐if ) #no shutdown [Enter] This will ensure that the ip address configuration is 
administratively up. i.e. The ip address is being used for routing purpose. 

Connect the router to the PC using the Crossover cable. Change the IP address of your computer by 
doing the following.
